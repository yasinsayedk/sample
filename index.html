<h2 class="animate__animated animate__heartBeat animate__slower animate__infinite"> About Cyberpunk </h2>

<p>
Cyberpunk 2077 is an upcoming action role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. It is scheduled to be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on 10 December 2020. Adapted from the Cyberpunk franchise, the story takes place in dystopian Night City, an open world with six distinct regions. Players assume the first-person perspective of a customisable mercenary known as V, who can acquire skills in hacking and machinery, an arsenal of ranged weapons, and options for melee combat.
<br><br>
Cyberpunk 2077 is being developed using the REDengine 4 by a team of around 500, exceeding the number that worked on the studio's previous game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015). To assist with production, CD Projekt launched a new division in Wrocław, Poland, and partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, and QLOC. Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith was a consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves has a starring role. The soundtrack features music by Marcin Przybyłowicz and several licensed artists. Adaptations include a comic book series, card game, and an anime.

<br><br><br><br>
Cyberpunk 2077 is played in a first-person perspective as V,[13] a mercenary whose voice,[14] face, hairstyles, body type and modifications, background, and clothing are customisable. Stat categories—Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical, and Cool—are influenced by the character classes that players assume, which are NetRunner (hacking), Techie (machinery), and Solo (combat). The perk tree branches into melee, blades, handguns, shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, hacking, two-handed combat, assassination, "cold blood", engineering, and athletics. V must consult a "ripperdoc" to upgrade and purchase cyberware implants; black markets offer military-grade abilities.[13][15][16][17][18][19] The rarity of any given equipment is shown by a coloured tier system.[20] V can take cover, aim, run, jump, double jump, and slide.[21][22] Melee strikes can be dealt with close-combat weapons.[16][23] There are three types of ranged weapons, all of which can be customised and modified—Power (standard), Tech (which penetrate walls and enemies), and Smart (with homing bullets).[24][25] Ranged weapons are equipped to ricochet bullets in a target's direction and slow them down in bullet time. Four types of damage can be inflicted and resisted—Physical, Thermal, EMP, and Chemical.[15][19][26] Weapon use increases accuracy and reloading speed, which are manifested in character animations.[27] Gunsmiths repair and upgrade weapons.[16] The game can be completed without killing anyone,[28] with non-lethal options for weapons and cyberware.[5]
<br><br>
The open world metropolis Night City, California consists of six regions—the corporate City Center, immigrant-inhabited Watson, luxurious Westbrook, suburban Heywood, gang-infested Pacifica, and industrial Santo Domingo. Its surrounding area, the Badlands, can also be explored. V navigates these locations on foot and in vehicles, which are subject to either a first or third-person view. In autonomous cars, V can more easily engage in gunplay.[13][20][26][29][30][31] Pedestrians are vulnerable to vehicular collisions.[25] Depending on the location, law enforcement may be alerted if V commits a crime.[32][33] Radio stations are available to listen to.[34] The full day-night cycle and dynamic weather affect the way non-player characters (NPCs) behave.[24][35] V owns an apartment and a garage.[16][36] Night City features non-English-speaking characters, whose languages can be translated with special implants.[37] "Braindance" is a device that allows V to undergo other people's experiences.[38][39] Branching dialogues enable interaction with NPCs and actions in quests.[40] Experience points are obtained from main quests and fuel the stats, while side quests yield "street cred", unlocking skills, vendors, places, and additional quests.[20][24][25][41] Quests are acquired from characters known as Fixers.[25] Throughout the game, V is aided by various companions.[16] Consumables, like soft drinks, are used for healing, and objects can be inspected in V's inventory.[22] Minigames include hacking, boxing, auto racing,[42] martial arts, and shooting ranges.[43] "Game over" messages only appear at the point of death; if a quest is failed, the game moves on all the same.[44] Player choice leads to different endings.[39]

<hr>
<p>Night City is an American megacity in the Free State of North California, controlled by corporations and unassailed by the laws of both country and state. It sees conflict from rampant gang wars and its ruling entities contending for dominance. The city is reliant on robotics for everyday aspects like waste collection, maintenance, and public transportation.[45][46] Its visual identity is derived from the four eras it underwent—austere Entropism, colourful Kitsch, imposing Neo-Militarism, and opulent Neo-Kitsch.[47] The Internet is managed by corporations and the army.[5] Homelessness abounds but does not preclude cybernetic modification for the poor, giving rise to cosmetic addiction and consequent violence. These threats are dealt with by the armed force known as Psycho Squad.[48][49] Trauma Team can be employed for rapid medical services.[50] Because of the constant threat of physical harm, all citizens are allowed to openly carry firearms in public.[51]</p>

<hr>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 entered pre-production when developer CD Projekt Red had finished The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Blood and Wine (2016),[52] with approximately fifty staff members involved.[53] They later devoted a team larger than that of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015),[54][b] and after it was released, began upgrading their REDengine 3 to complement Cyberpunk 2077.[58] CD Projekt Red was granted subventions of US$7 million by the Polish government, whose funding application confirmed they were using REDengine 4.[59] In June 2017, preliminary designs were stolen and threatened to be released to the public, but the developer refused to comply.[60][61] The development reportedly reached a milestone in late 2017,[62] and in March 2018, a new studio opened in Wrocław to aid the production.[63] That October, CD Projekt Red established a partnership with Canadian studio Digital Scapes to craft additional tools for Cyberpunk 2077.[64] The developer partnered with Nvidia in June 2019 to achieve ray tracing in real time,[65] and QLOC in January 2020 for quality assurance.[66]
<br><br>
Stream processing and global illumination were made to function without overwhelming the central processing unit.[67] Ray tracing improved the graphics of the global illumination, reflections, ambient occlusion, and shadows.[68] Originally to launch with multiplayer,[69] this was first assigned to research and development,[70] and later declared as a post-release feature.[71] The first-person perspective was chosen to immerse players more than what third-person would allow.[24] Cutscenes and gameplay were both made in first-person to seamlessly blend together.[72][73] Cyberpunk 2077 features full nudity, which game director Adam Badowski said encapsulates the theme of transhumanism—"the body is no longer sacrum [sacred]; it's profanum [profane]".[74] The script was written in Polish and a separate team translated the dialogue into English.[75] The quest designers, who oversaw the making of their own ideas, enabled players to decide the order in which quests are undertaken.[76] Side quests were often made from unused parts of the main story.[77] CD Projekt Red invented a technology based on sound analysis from neural networks, producing real-time lip sync for all localisations.[78] Animation systems were remade to better generate muscle movement, motion capture was improved, and environments were created from prefabricated designs.[79] Reused models had their colours and details altered.[80] Some things were procedurally generated.[57] Feedback from E3 2018 influenced the non-lethal playthrough and removed the male-female option in character customisation, instead basing it on voice and body type.[81][82] Night City was designed with the help of urban planners,[83] and its architecture drew on Brutalism.[84] The world is loaded using vertical streaming to render only the assets that appear on screen.[85] By August 2018, the story was fully realised and could facilitate a complete playthrough.[2] The content was nearly complete in mid-2019, with the rest of development focused largely on polishing.[56] Staff started working from home in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[86] causing a halt in localisation.[87] Despite the studio's disavowal of mandatory overtime in May and June 2019,[88][89] "crunch time" was implemented in the final weeks.[90]</p>

<hr>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 won over one hundred awards at E3 2018,[65] including Best Game, Best Xbox One Game, Best PC Game,[165] Best RPG,[166] and People's Choice at IGN,[167] Best Role-Playing Game and Game of the Show at Game Informer,[168] Best of E3 at PC Gamer,[169] and Game of the Show at GamesRadar+.[170] The second trailer was considered one of the best at the expo,[171][172][173][174] although writer William Gibson, credited with pioneering the cyberpunk subgenre, described it as "GTA skinned-over with a generic 80s retro-future".[175] Gibson later expressed an affinity toward the first gameplay demo.[176] The first-person perspective, in contrast with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's third-person, was subject to criticism.[177][178] Cyberpunk 2077 was the most widely discussed game of E3 2019,[179] where it was presented awards for Best of E3 at GamesRadar+, PC Gamer, Rock, Paper, Shotgun, and Ars Technica,[180][181][182][183] and Best Game, People's Choice, Best PS4 Game, Best Xbox One Game, Best PC Game, and Best RPG at IGN.[184] The third trailer was lauded with emphasis on Reeves' reveal.</p>
